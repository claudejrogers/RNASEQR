RNASEQR - A streamlined and accurate RNA-seq sequence analysis program 
=========================================================================

RNASEQR is a nucleotide sequence mapper/aligner and is designed specifically for RNA-seq data analysis. It takes advantage of the annotated transcripts and genomic reference sequences to obtain high quality mapping/alignment results. Therefore, RNASEQR may not have a better performance when a genome-wide transcriptomic annotation is unavailable. Fortunately, comprehensive transcriptomic annotation is available for most model organisms.
